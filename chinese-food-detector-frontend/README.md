# Chinese Food Detector Frontend
Advanced Machine Learning Project

### Installation

    npm install -g gulp
    npm install

### Development
For development run `npm start`. That will run a server with `live-reload` at `http://localhost:8000` and will also **watch** for any `js` & `LESS` changes.

    npm start

If you only want to build the app use:

    npm run build

### Tests

    npm test
